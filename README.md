# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle-related parameters. It aims to assist in early diagnosis and prevention by utilizing machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction and prevention can save lives. This project leverages machine learning â€” specifically **logistic regression** â€” to predict heart disease risk from health indicators using the **Framingham dataset**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Name:** Framingham Heart Study Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Features include:**
  - Age, Gender
  - Cigarettes per Day
  - Blood Pressure (systolic and diastolic)
  - Diabetes, Glucose Level
  - Cholesterol (Total)
  - Heart Rate, BMI
  - TenYearCHD (Target variable: 0 or 1)

## ðŸ§ª Approach

- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
- **Steps:**
  1. Load and clean the data
  2. Handle missing values
  3. Perform data visualization
  4. Split the dataset into training and test sets
  5. Train logistic regression model
  6. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, confusion matrix
